### Project 4: Thread Local Storage

* In this project we are creating a thread local storage and the functions to manipulate them. We are implementing a way to have protected memory regions for our threads, or the ones in the pthread library. And we are going to give that protected memory region the ability to be cloned from one thread to another, and once you have cloned it give it the ability to have some CoW (Copy on Write) features.
